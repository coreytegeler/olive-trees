The Yazidi community in Bashiqa town are celebrating the building of Hasan Fardoos Shrine in the outskirts of the town. Not a single a Yazidi place of worship, Christian church, or Muslim mosques was left unscathed when ISIS militiamen's overran parts in northern Iraq in 2014. But now after the liberation of Mosul in 2016, people took it on their own to volunteer and rebuild everything to give hope to their community to return and also other communities to stand on their feet again and follow the same steps.
